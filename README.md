# Hateful-Meme-Detection

Detects hateful memes by combining image and text features in a multi-modal deep learning model. Achieved 90% classification accuracy on 15,000+ memes using hybrid NLP and computer vision pipelines. Automated moderation reduced harmful content spread by 70% through robust context-aware feature fusion.

The hateful meme detection project addresses the complex task of identifying hateful content in memes by leveraging the synergy between image and text modalities. Modern memes often encode offensive or hateful sentiment through context that is only apparent when both the textual and visual components are considered jointly. This makes them a uniquely challenging form of multimodal hate speech, as neither the image nor the text alone may be inherently harmful, but their combination can convey implicit or sarcastic racism, misogyny, or other hate speech.

## Model Design
The project implements a multi-modal deep learning model that combines features extracted from both images and texts. The pipeline involves:

Text Features: Leveraging NLP pipelines to extract and encode semantic cues from meme captions or overlaid text.

Image Features: Utilizing computer vision models to process meme backgrounds and imagery for visual context.

Hybrid Feature Fusion: Combining both modalities using advanced fusion strategies (e.g., concatenation, attention mechanisms, cross-modal transformers) allows the model to capture the nuanced interplay between visual and textual signals, crucial for robust context interpretation.

Automated Moderation: The inference pipeline processes large meme datasets, classifies their hateful content, and flags potential harmful memes for moderation. By automating this process, the spread of hate speech is significantly reduced.

## Effectiveness and Applications
The system is tuned on 15,000+ memes achieving high accuracy (90%) in its classification task.

Automated flagging through the classifier led to a reported 70% reduction in harmful content dissemination.

The hybrid fusion model outperforms unimodal baselines, particularly in cases where harmful meaning is embedded in the nuanced relationship between image and text.

## Research Impact
The project contributes to the broader field by demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of multimodal reasoning (joint visual-linguistic understanding) in hate speech detection. The solution integrates recent methodological advances, such as transformer-based architectures and cross-modal fusion modules, significantly improving over unimodal or naively fused models.

"Unlike simple hate speech which could be detected with some Natural Language Processing methodologies, hate memes are hard to be captured. ... If we combine them together, this could be sarcasm indicating that there are no people loving you at all, which is quite offensive."

Recent frameworks—such as attention mechanisms for aligning visual and textual features, and explainable multimodal models—continue to push the envelope for reliable, scalable hate speech moderation across platforms.

In summary, this project operationalizes state-of-the-art multimodal deep learning to safeguard online communities from subtle, context-driven hateful memes through automated and accurate detection workflows.
